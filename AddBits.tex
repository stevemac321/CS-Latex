\section*{State Machine Design}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Start State:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initialization begins with \texttt{carry\_flag} set to \texttt{0}.
        \item This state prepares the system for reading the LSBs of the input integers.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{State ZERO:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handles cases where the sum of \texttt{bit\_a}, \texttt{bit\_b}, and \texttt{carry\_flag} equals \texttt{0}.
        \item Transitions and results:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{sum = 0}, \texttt{carry\_flag = 0}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{State ONE:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handles cases where the sum of \texttt{bit\_a}, \texttt{bit\_b}, and \texttt{carry\_flag} equals \texttt{1}.
        \item Transitions and results:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{sum = 1}, \texttt{carry\_flag = 0}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{State TWO:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handles cases where the sum of \texttt{bit\_a}, \texttt{bit\_b}, and \texttt{carry\_flag} equals \texttt{2}.
        \item Transitions and results:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{sum = 0}, \texttt{carry\_flag = 1}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{State THREE:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handles cases where the sum of \texttt{bit\_a}, \texttt{bit\_b}, and \texttt{carry\_flag} equals \texttt{3}.
        \item Transitions and results:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{sum = 1}, \texttt{carry\_flag = 1}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Final State:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is the accepting or termination state.
        \item Handles the situation where the last carry bit needs to be added if the final state results in a carry.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Loop Invariant Properties}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{Initialization Property:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first LSBs are read with \texttt{carry\_flag = 0}, setting up the loop invariant.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Maintenance Property:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each iteration maintains the correct sum and carry based on the current state and the bits being added, transitioning appropriately between \texttt{ZERO}, \texttt{ONE}, \texttt{TWO}, and \texttt{THREE}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Termination Property:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The loop ends when all bits have been processed, and the final state handles any remaining carry.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Feedback}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
    \item \textbf{State Naming:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The states \texttt{ZERO}, \texttt{ONE}, \texttt{TWO}, and \texttt{THREE} are clear and directly represent the possible sums of \texttt{bit\_a}, \texttt{bit\_b}, and \texttt{carry\_flag}, simplifying the logic.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{State Transitions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The transitions are now more straightforward with only four possible states, making the implementation cleaner and reducing complexity.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Clarity in Explanation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The description is now more concise due to the reduced number of states, making the logic easier to follow.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Testing:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Testing the state machine should be easier with fewer states. Ensure that test cases cover all possible scenarios, especially edge cases where \texttt{carry\_flag} affects the next bit.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conclusion}
Your revised approach with the reduced number of states (\texttt{ZERO}, \texttt{ONE}, \texttt{TWO}, \texttt{THREE}) simplifies the state machine and makes the logic more efficient. This streamlined approach is well-suited for implementation in languages like Rust or C++, ensuring both clarity and correctness in your binary addition algorithm.
