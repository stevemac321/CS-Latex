\section{Introduction}

This document reviews the discussions on Sedgewick's formula 2.1 from the 3rd edition of \textit{Algorithms}. The focus is on understanding the concept of linear recursion as described by the formula and how it contrasts with other recursive techniques.

\section{Sedgewick's Formula 2.1}

Formula 2.1 in Sedgewick's book describes a recurrence relation:
\[
C(N) = C(N-1) + N
\]
for $N \geq 2$ with $C(1) = 1$. Here, $C(N)$ represents the cost or time complexity of solving a problem of size $N$.

\subsection{Explanation of the Terms}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C(N)}: The cost or time complexity of solving the problem for size $N$.
    \item \textbf{C(N-1)}: The cost of solving a subproblem of size $N-1$.
    \item \textbf{N}: Represents the additional work done at each level of the recursion, typically proportional to the size of the problem.
    \item \textbf{C(1) = 1}: The base case, which states that the cost of solving the problem when $N = 1$ is 1 unit of time.
\end{itemize}

The recurrence relation describes a \textbf{linear recursive process} where each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1, and the total cost is the sum of the costs of these recursive calls.

\section{Linear Recursion}

\subsection{Definition}

Linear recursion refers to a type of recursion where each function call makes exactly one recursive call to solve a subproblem, and the problem size is reduced by a constant amount (typically by 1) with each call. The process is linear because the depth of the recursion tree is proportional to the size of the input.

\subsection{Example: Summing an Array}

Consider a simple example where we recursively sum the elements of an array:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Summing an Array using Linear Recursion]
int sum(int arr[], int N) {
    if (N == 0) {
        return 0;  // Base case: empty array has a sum of 0
    } else {
        return arr[N-1] + sum(arr, N-1);  // Recursively sum the rest of the array
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Case}: When $N = 0$, the function returns 0.
    \item \textbf{Recursive Step}: The function processes the last element, adds it to the sum of the remaining elements (which is handled by the recursive call).
    \item \textbf{Cost}: The cost at each level is constant, and there are $N$ levels, leading to a total time complexity of $O(N)$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recursive Descent}

\subsection{Definition}

Recursive descent refers to the process of progressively breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems through recursion. Each recursive call typically reduces the problem size, leading to a "descent" through the levels of recursion.

\subsection{Example: Removing an Element from an Array}

Consider a recursive function that removes the first element of an array and processes the rest:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=Removing the First Element using Linear Recursion]
void removeFirstElement(int arr[], int N) {
    if (N == 0) {
        return;  // Base case: empty array
    }
    
    // Process the first element (e.g., just printing it)
    std::cout << arr[0] << std::endl;
    
    // Recursive call to remove the first element
    removeFirstElement(arr + 1, N - 1);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Base Case}: When $N = 0$, the recursion stops.
    \item \textbf{Recursive Step}: The function processes the first element and recursively calls itself to handle the rest of the array.
    \item \textbf{Recursive Breakdown}: The problem size decreases by 1 with each recursive call, leading to a linear sequence of operations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Insights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sedgewick's formula describes the \textbf{recursive breakdown} of a problem, where each step of the recursion performs a small amount of work and then calls itself on a smaller subproblem.
    \item The recursion described by $C(N) = C(N-1) + N$ is linear in nature because the problem size decreases by 1 with each step, leading to a total time complexity of $O(N^2)$ when unrolled.
    \item Understanding the concept of \textbf{recursive descent} is crucial for analyzing recursive algorithms, as it highlights how the problem is progressively simplified until it reaches the base case.
\end{itemize}
